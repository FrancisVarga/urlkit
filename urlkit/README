BUILDING

All projects may be built either using Ant or Eclipse.

The Eclipse projects are compatible with the public beta2 build of Flex Builder 3,
since it provides multi-SDK support.  You can easily enough delete the project files and re-import into
Flex Builder 2 if you prefer to use that.

The Eclipse projects are set up to build against the 2.0.1hf3 SDK.  The Ant files will build
against either SDK.  You must override the definition of the flex.home variable to point
to your Flex install directory.

USAGE

1. Add the library bin/urlkit.swc or bin/urlkitFlex3.swc into your ActionScript
classpath.  The MXML components associated with UrlKit are all available
at the following component manifest URL:

    http://www.allurent.com/2006/urlkit


2. Add UrlKit components to your project as needed.

3. FOR FLEX 2 ONLY: Modify your application's HTML source code as follows.  (Flex 3
   now includes its own history-management Javascript in the standard HTML template, included
   here as sample/html-template-flex3/.  You do not need to modify it.)

  a. ensure that the standard Flex "history" IFRAME is not included.

  b. either use the exact scripting approach shown in html-template/index.template.html
     or include all material comments marked "REQUIRED UrlKit SECTION".
     
  c. if not using the index.template.html approach to generating your OBJECT/EMBED
     markup, then be sure you're not nesting an EMBED tag inside an OBJECT tag in
     your system as this breaks Safari bookmarking support.
     

  d. Add the following files from the html-template/ directory to the same directory
     containing the page that loads your Flex application:

	historyFrame.html
	urlkit.css
	urlkit.js


DOCUMENTATION

Please see the files UrlKit.htm (HTML) or UrlKit.doc (MS Word).  Beyond that,
the source code comments provide a more detailed guide to the full
functionality of the package.
